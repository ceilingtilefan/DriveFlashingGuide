# Maxine's Ultimate Drive Flashing Guide

## NOTES: I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE DONE TO YOUR CONSOLE AND/OR DVD DRIVE!
## I AM ALSO NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU GET BANNED FOR USING A FLASHED DVD DRIVE. WHEN USING A FLASHED DVD DRIVE YOU FACE THE RISK OF GETTING BANNED.

Before you start this guide, ensure your console is on the latest version of the dashboard (2.0.17559.0). 

Requirements:
- Fairly old PC (Windows XP, Vista, or 7) with a [compatible chipset](https://consolemods.org/wiki/Xbox_360:Drive_Flashing#Compatible_Chipsets_for_Flashing). I recommend Windows XP due to the lack of driver signature enforcement.
- SATA cable to connect your Xbox 360 DVD drive to your PC
