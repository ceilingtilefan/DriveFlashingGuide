# Maxine's Ultimate Xbox 360 Drive Flashing Guide

## NOTES: I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE DONE TO YOUR CONSOLE AND/OR DVD DRIVE!
## I AM ALSO NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU GET BANNED FOR USING A FLASHED DVD DRIVE. WHEN USING A FLASHED DVD DRIVE YOU FACE THE RISK OF GETTING BANNED. IF YOU USE BADUPDATE TO GET YOUR DVD KEY, YOU ALSO FACE THE RISK OF GETTING BANNED.
## THIS GUIDE IS STILL IN PROGRESS. IF YOU CANNOT FIND WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR HERE, PLEASE CHECK OUT [NOOBERT'S FLASHING GUIDE](https://www.se7ensins.com/forums/threads/nooberts-flashing-guide-phat-slim-burner-max-payload-burn-games.1150969/)

Before you start this guide, ensure your console is on the latest version of the dashboard (2.0.17559.0). 

Requirements:
- Fairly old PC (Windows XP, Vista, or 7) with a [compatible chipset](https://consolemods.org/wiki/Xbox_360:Drive_Flashing#Compatible_Chipsets_for_Flashing). I recommend Windows XP due to the lack of driver signature enforcement.
- SATA cable to connect your Xbox 360 DVD drive to your PC
- USB drive (to get the DVD key of drives that required special tools)
